# Rust Particles

Little particle simulation written in Rust for learning purposes.

There are 8 types of particle. Particles will bounce off of particles of another type, but will disappear if they bounce off of a particle of the same type.

TODO: Particles should cluster together when they meet particles of the same type.
TODO: Particle clusters should consume clusters of other types that are at least 4(?) times smaller.
